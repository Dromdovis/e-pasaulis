I've identified the root cause of your image upload issue and made significant changes to the `stream_all_images_to_pocketbase` method to fix it. The main problems with the original implementation were:

1. **Using the wrong Python library for file uploads**: The `self.pb_client.send()` method wasn't properly handling multipart file uploads. The logs showed HTTP 200 responses, but the files weren't actually being attached correctly.

2. **Incorrect field naming**: The code was using `'images[]'` for gallery images, but PocketBase API expects just `'images'` for the array field.

3. **Lack of response verification**: The code wasn't checking if the returned data actually contained populated image fields.

The new implementation makes these key improvements:

1. **Uses the `requests` library directly**: This provides more reliable multipart form uploads that work properly with PocketBase. The `requests` library has better support for file uploads than the custom PocketBase client.

2. **Corrects field names**: Uses `'image'` for the thumbnail and `'images'` (without brackets) for gallery images.

3. **Verifies response data**: After each upload, it checks if the response JSON contains the expected image fields, which will help catch issues.

4. **Better error handling**: Provides more detailed error logs including HTTP status codes and response content when failures occur.

5. **Improved file management**: First downloads all images, then processes uploads sequentially with proper cleanup after each.

To test this fix:

1. Make sure the `requests` library is installed (run `pip install requests` if needed)
2. Run the scraper again with the modified code
3. Check your PocketBase admin panel to see if the images appear properly

The logs will now be more informative if errors occur, showing exactly what went wrong with each upload attempt. If the issue persists, we can further debug with the enhanced logging.
